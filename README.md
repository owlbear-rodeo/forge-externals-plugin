Forked from [https://github.com/timfish/forge-externals-plugin](https://github.com/timfish/forge-externals-plugin)

When using Electron with Webpack, the easiest way to support native
modules is to add them to Webpack `externals` configuration. This tells webpack
to load them from `node_modules` via `require()`:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules,
  },
  plugins: plugins,
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".js", ".ts", ".jsx", ".tsx", ".css"],
  },
  externals: {
    // Always load `native-hello-world` via require
    "native-hello-world": "commonjs2 native-hello-world",
  },
};
```

This works in development but with Electron Forge + Webpack,
`node_modules` gets excluded during packaging so the modules are missing in the
packaged app.

This plugin should be added after `@electron-forge/plugin-webpack` and it
ensures that your external modules and their dependencies are included in the
packaged app.
